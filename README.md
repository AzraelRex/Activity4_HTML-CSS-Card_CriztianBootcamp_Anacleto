This is a simple card design that I made using HTML and CSS.
This is also my submission for Activity4 of my colleague Mr.Criztian Tuplano's front-end web development bootcamp.

While the design is still being coded, and it is far from finished, I did learn a decent amount of things while making
this project along with the previous assignments as well.

For example for this one I learned about the utilization of VH  along with VW, in CSS.
Another thing that I learned is that I must start of some code in my css file by calling the div class name of my HTML,
which for this project was glowing card. 

Another thing that I learned from this project what RBG colors were, and how there were many developers that constantly
used them, so today with the help of the Google search engine, I managed to learn about some common RGB colors and even
start implementing them in my project.

I will continue the update this project tomorrow till it's deadline .
